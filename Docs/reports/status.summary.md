# Project Status Summary

## 1. TL;DR
- Unity 2022.3 project located under `UnityGame/`.
- Core scenes and bootstrap scripts exist; gameplay content largely placeholders.
- Config directories for levels, enemies, items are empty; localization has basic table.
- URP with 2D Renderer detected; SRP Batcher enabled.
- No object pooling, Addressables release or log level controls found.
- CI covers only archived Python prototype; no Unity workflow.
- Estimated playable time: ~5 minutes due to minimal content.

## 3. Playable Loop & Content Status
| Item | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Scenes `Bootstrap`, `Hub`, `Biome_A/B/C`, `Boss` | ✅ | All present |
| Scripts `GameBootstrap.cs`, `ConfigService.cs`, `PlaceholderFactory.cs` | ✅ | Loaded and functional |
| Config dirs `Levels`, `Enemies`, `Items`, `Localization` | ⚠️ | Directories exist but empty except localization |
| Localization `strings.csv` | ✅ | Minimal entries |
| Enemy/Weapon/Room configs | ❌ | None found |
| Save/Meta progression | ❌ | No implementation |

## 4. Estimated Playtime & Basis
Approx. **5 minutes** – can load Hub and traverse placeholder biomes but lacks enemies, progression and result screens.

## 5. Performance & Stability Concerns
- No object pooling or resource release patterns.
- Addressables assets loaded but never released.
- Lack of log level control may spam console.

## 6. CI / Workflow / Standards
- `.github/workflows/python-app.yml` only tests archived Python code.
- PR template exists but no commit conventions or QA docs.

## 7. Next-step Recommendations
| Priority | Branch | Deliverable |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | `feature/core-loop` | Implement enemy waves, result screen to close gameplay loop |
| P0 | `content/base-configs` | Populate level/enemy/item JSON configs and generation rules |
| P1 | `feature/save-system` | Add save slots and meta progression infrastructure |
| P1 | `feature/localization` | Expand localization tables and pipeline |
| P2 | `ci/unity-build` | Add Unity build/test workflow to CI |
| P2 | `tech/object-pooling` | Introduce pooling and Addressables release logic |
