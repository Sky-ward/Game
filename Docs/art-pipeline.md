# Art Pipeline

## Sprite Import Settings

- **Naming**: Sprite textures must start with `spr_` and reside under `Assets/Art`.
- **Type**: Imported as *Sprite (2D and UI)*.
- **Compression**: Uses `Compressed` texture compression.
- **Mip Maps**: Disabled.

### Workflow
1. Drop the PNG into `Assets/Art` with a `spr_` prefix.
2. The `AssetPostprocessor` automatically applies import settings and warns on naming errors.
3. Verify in the Inspector that the sprite type and compression match the guidelines.

These rules ensure consistent, memoryâ€‘efficient textures across the project.
